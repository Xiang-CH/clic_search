    "The incense next door is really stinky and unbearable I thought I could finally get a house in a 30-year-old private housing estate I thought it would be okay if it is not a haunted house, but little did I know the people who lived on my floor were crazy. Someone always forcefully closes the door. They keep opening and closing the door dozens of times a day (they have already entered the house, so I have no idea why do they keep opening and closing the door with great force. My child was woken up by the sound several times. I’ve complained but it doesn’t work) On the other side, the flat next door light the incense three times a day, in the morning, afternoon and evening, even more frequent than my meals It's really unbearable. Basically, every time I go out they coincidentally start incensing. I've already placed a lot of sponges and used air purifiers in the house. But the smell would go into my house when I open the door slightly to go out. The worst thing is when they finished lighting the incense they would close their door. If they like it so much they should enjoy the smell in front of their door. It is a completely meaningless thing to light incense. It's none of my business if their house becomes a temple. The problem is that they always light the incense at the door but the corridor is not ventilated and I am living next door, which is really unbearable. Do you have the same experience or solutions?",

    `我搬到了一个历史悠久的小区，希望能找到一个安居的住所。然而，隔壁的熏香却令人无法忍受。我原本以为只要不闹鬼就没问题，但我不知道住在我这一层的人都发神经。他们一天不停地开关门几十次，即使他们已经在家里，完全没有理由频繁开关门。这些噪音吵醒了我的孩子好几次。我曾经投诉过，但没有起到作用。
    此外，隔壁的邻居每天早上、下午和晚上都点香，比我吃饭还频繁，真的很难忍受。几乎每次我一出门，他们就会点香，无论我是否在家。我已经在房子里放了很多海绵和用过的空气净化器，但每当我稍微打开门，气味就会飘进我的房子。更糟糕的是，他们点完香后会关上自己的门。如果他们喜欢点香，他们应该享受那个气味。但如果不喜欢那个味道, 甚至要关上门的话，烧香就几乎是一件完全没有意义的事情。他们想让自己的房子变成寺庙，这与我无关。问题是，他们总是在门口点香，而走廊没有通风，我住在隔壁，这真的让人难以忍受。`,
